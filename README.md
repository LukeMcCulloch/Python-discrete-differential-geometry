# Python discrete differential geometry

Discrete Differential Geometry Processing in Python

Notes:  The included "assignments" demonstrate some initial applications of discrete differential geometry and the exterior calculus to geometric processing tasks.  They also serve as an introduction to computational simulation of simple PDE's on a manifold.

To run these little python demos, you will need methes, e.g. the Standord bunny. 
For testing my code, it's easiest to pull my mesh repo and situate them together at the same level in a directory.
"My" meshes are [here](https://github.com/LukeMcCulloch/meshes.git)
